# UI Package Adoption Guide - Tracc

## Changes Made

This app has been migrated to use the shared `@andrea/repo-ui` package.

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@andrea/repo-ui` as a dependency via `npm link`

### 2. CSS Import
- Added `import "@andrea/repo-ui/styles.css";` in `src/main.jsx`

### 3. Component Replacements
- **ThemeProvider**: Replaced `./components/ThemeProvider` with `@andrea/repo-ui`
- **ThemeSwitch**: Replaced `ThemeDropdown` with `ThemeSwitch` from `@andrea/repo-ui`
- **Button**: Updated Header component to use `@andrea/repo-ui`

### 4. Files Removed
- `src/components/ThemeProvider.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/theme-dropdown.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/theme-toggle.jsx`

### 5. Theme Integration
- The app now uses the standardized theme system with CSS custom properties
- Dark/light mode switching works via the new ThemeSwitch component
- Theme state is managed by the shared ThemeProvider

## Verification
- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ Theme switching functionality preserved
- ✅ UI components work with new package
- ✅ No duplicate theme-related code

## Next Steps
- Test the app in development mode to verify theme switching
- Consider migrating more UI components (Input, Label, Table) as needed
- After testing, replace `npm link` with `npm install @andrea/repo-ui` when published
